    <p>Description: For my project I am going to build off of the week 6 assignment by using multiple space related API's. The purpose of the website is to be informational and to display the information in a creative way. The API's I have in mind so far is people in space, one about the international space station including data like the location and velocity, and a couple others about the solar system and planets with information about whether it’s a planet, star, asteroid, etc, and random facts like density and average temperature. I’m going to include some images as well and maybe the nasa picture of the day api or one of the other nasa api’s that include images. Another idea is to have links to other websites with more in depth information and any articles that relate to the data on my page. For design I just want it to have a space/galaxy theme so I'll most likely use a background image for that then use some sort of javascript or css transformation to make it more interesting. Other design ideas would be to display buttons instead of links that will say learn more or something like that. I want it to be one page, but possibly have a navigation at the top that when a link is clicked it will scroll down to a certain spot instead of opening a new page</p>

    <p>The pictures below are examples of layout and style ideas for the page</p>
